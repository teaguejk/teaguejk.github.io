This project started as a documentation writing excercise for Technical Writing. I decided to pick one of my favorite video games, Stardew Valley, and create a static wiki site that goes over some of the basics of the game. It is currently a static site that I originally created using Jekyl, as I was learning the basics of technical writing and github pages. After graduating, I started writing a 2nd version in AngularJS to continue to learn different ways of creating and deploying static sites.
