Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Jaracah Teague and I am currently a Software Engineer at Inmar Intelligence. I graduated in May of 2022, with a bachelors degree in Computer Science from Appalachian State University. On this website I plan to post and outline some of the projects I have worked on and had fun with. Thank you for stopping by.
