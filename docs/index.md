Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Jaracah Teague, I am currently a Software Engineer at Inmar Intelligence. I graduated college in May of 2022, with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from Appalachian State University. On this website I plan to post and outline some of the projects I have worked on and had fun with. Thank you for stopping by.
